// A RESTful API
// An API, or application programming interface, is kind of like a coding contract: it specifies the ways a program can interact with an application. For example, if you want to write a program that reads and analyzes data from Twitter, you'd need to use the Twitter API, which would specify the process for authentication, important URLs, classes, methods, and so on.

// For an API or web service to be RESTful, it must do the following:

// Separate the client from the server
// Not hold state between requests (meaning that all the information necessary to respond to a request is available in each individual request; no data, or state, is held by the server from request to request)
// Use HTTP and HTTP methods (as explained in the next section).
// There are some other requirements, but they're beyond the scope of this lesson.

// Instructions
// Check out the code in the editor. This is an example of the kind of information we can get from an API! (It's in a format called JSON, which we'll explain soon.)
