Endpoints
Endpoints are API-defined locations where particular data are stored. Just as you'll GET a pair of pants from PantsWorld or you'll GET a bag of peanuts from PeanutHut, you'll GET something different depending on the endpoint you use.

For instance, if you're using the API for a video hosting service, there might be endpoints for the most popular videos, the most recent videos, or videos belonging to a certain genre or category.
