// XML or JSON?
// This leads us to wonder, though: how do we know whether an API will reply with XML or JSON?

// The only way you'll know what type of data an API will send you is to read that API's documentation! Some will reply with one, and some will reply with the other. Documentation is a programmer's best friend, and it's always in your best interest to read it so you understand that what the API expects from you and what the API intends to send you when you make a request.
